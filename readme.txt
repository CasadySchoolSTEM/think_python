This folder contains solutions to almost all end-of-chapter exercises of Allen Downey's Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. The solutions refer to the exercises in version 2.0.9 (May 2013) of the book.

Exercises involving "Turtle World" (ch. 4), GUI programming (ch. 19), and OOP (ch. 15 - 18) were either partly or completely skipped.

The folder /extra contains a number of supporting files:

- Allen Downey: Think Python v.2.0.9 (PDF)
- polygon.py, which is required for some exercises
- pg1661.txt, a book from Project Gutenberg, used in some exercises
- words.txt, a list of 100k+ words, used in some exercises
- words2.txt, a small subset of words.txt
- c06d.txt, the Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary, used in some exercises
- swampy-2.1.1, a library that is required for Turtle World exercises

All .py files were written in Python 2.7.
